# Undergraduate Programs

## Why Study Computer Science?
Participate in a thriving intellectual and professional community; learn to build usable and useful computational systems and tools; develop skills to solve complex problems; gain expertise in a highly marketable field; prepare yourself for valuable work in almost any type of industry.

## What You Can Do with a Computer Science Degree
Graduates from our department are in demand in the job market and for graduate school.

## CS Majors and Minors
Computer Science students enjoy a liberal arts setting in the UO’s College of Arts and Sciences. Most students graduate in four years, and can combine their major with a minor or an additional major such as Data Science, Math, or Psychology. They may also pursue our honors program.

Our students have many hands-on opportunities including undergraduate research and study abroad, career/internship seminars, student computer labs and meeting rooms where students can gather for work and co-curricular activities.

## Departmental Honors
Students in the Computer Science honors program can work closely with faculty to complete an undergraduate honors thesis. The experience is a strong preparation for graduate programs.

## Accelerated B.S./M.S.
Computer Science undergraduate majors at the UO have the opportunity to graduate with B.S. and M.S. Computer Science degrees in a five-year program.

## Real-World Experience
A major in computer science exposes you to research, internships, study abroad opportunities and more. Gaining real-world experiences such as programming is the key for students preparing for job roles such as software engineers, data analysts, and research scientists in computer and information industries.

## CIT Minor
In addition to the minor in Computer Science our department offers, the CIT Minor program focuses on expanding the base technical expertise of non-CS students at the University of Oregon. The minor curriculum includes learning to create web applications from start to finish, working with databases, security and network topics, fundamental computer topics and skills, and acquiring many of the practical software and information technology skills required in today’s workforce.

## Scholarships and Awards
Learn about ways to apply for funding like scholarships and fellowships through the Department of Computer Science, as well as the College and University.
