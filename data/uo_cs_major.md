# CS Major Requirements

Why Study Computer Science? What’s required to earn a degree? It's all summarized in our major map for Computer Science (CS).

## Major Concentrations

Concentrations highlight areas of specialization within the department and guide student elective choices. Each concentration has an approved list of CS courses, available from the computer science office or the department website. Concentrations may also include recommended science or mathematics courses or a recommended minor in another field.

COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS) MAJOR
## CS General Information
Computer science is a vast source of intellectual challenges, from understanding the fundamental mathematics of computational complexity to designing the next generation of Internet protocols to organizing and distributing vast stores of genomics data. Computer science is a rapidly-growing field, and graduates are in demand in the job market and for graduate school. The CS major provides a broad, comprehensive education that prepares graduates not only to adapt to future opportunities, but also to create them.

## CS General University Requirements
To earn a UO bachelor's degree, you must satisfy general university requirements as stated in the UO Catalog for the year you entered the major.
The College of Arts and Sciences awards both Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees to students who major in CS. If you fulfill the CS major requirements, you will automatically qualify for a BS degree. To qualify for the BA degree, you must also fulfill the College of Arts and Science's language requirement.

## Declaring the CS Major
Students interested in a CS major must meet with a Tykeson Hall Academic Advisor on the Scientific Discovery and Sustainability (SDS) team prior to declaring the major.
During the advising appointment, you will develop an academic plan for completing the CS major. You are also encouraged to meet with an advisor as you progress through the major to be sure that you are satisfying your major and UO degree requirements.

## CS Degree Overview
To obtain a computer science degree, you must satisfy the specific CS major requirements as stated in the UO Catalog at the time you are admitted to the major:
- CS major core courses
- CS upper-division concentration and elective requirements
- Math, Science, and Writing requirements

## CS Upper-Division and Elective Concentration Requirements
Concentrations highlight areas of specialization within the department and guide student elective choices. Each concentration has an approved list of CS courses, available from the computer science office or from the list below. Concentrations may also include recommended science and math courses; some include a recommended minor in another field. The department offers the following choices of CS concentrations:
- High Performance Computing/Computational Science
- Computer Networks
- Computer Security
- Machine Learning/AI/Data Science
- Foundations
- Software Development

## CS Major Progress Review
Students should schedule an appointment with a CS advisor and complete a CS Major Progress Review Form after beginning CS upper-division core courses.

## Satisfactory Progress in the CS Major Lower Division
Computer Science supports student preparedness for upper-division courses, as indicated by grades earned in lower-division prerequisite courses. Strong preparation in lower-division courses provides the foundation for success in major upper-division courses and continuous progress toward major and UO degree requirements. Students must earn grades of B- or higher in CS 210, 211, and 212 to automatically advance to most upper-division CS courses.  In addition, B- or better grades in Discrete Math (Math 231 and 232) are needed to advance to CS 313.    
When a student receives a grade lower than a B- in one of the prerequisite courses, students should repeat the course to earn the required B- or higher grade prior to attempting subsequent courses. Students repeating a course should plan to take advantage of supplemental instruction opportunities such as weekly Class Encore small group meetings and daily drop-in help hours.
Students with at most one C-level grade in lower-division required prerequisite courses may petition for a prerequisite override to register for an upper-division course.  
Students are required to meet with a Tykeson Hall Academic Advisor before submitting a petition for a prerequisite override to register for an upper-division course. Your advisor will assist you in determining next steps and submitting a petition, if this is determined to be appropriate.
Petitions should be sent to advising@cs.uoregon.edu for review by the CS Undergraduate Education Committee.  Petitions should include your student id (95) number and the email should cc: the advisor with whom you spoke.  

## Satisfactory Progress in the CS Major Upper Division
All upper-division coursework must be completed with a grade of C- or better. Unless otherwise indicated, all required coursework used to satisfy major requirements must be taken graded. At least 12 credits of CS upper division elective courses numbered 410 or higher must be taken graded.
Students who receive two grades below C- in upper-division courses are not making satisfactory progress in the major. Students not making satisfactory progress should schedule an appointment with a Tykeson Hall Academic Advisor on the Scientific Discovery and Sustainability (SDS) team as soon as possible to discuss the best way to proceed, for example, modifying the degree plan or exploring options including other majors, possibly with a CS minor.

## CS Petitions
Exceptions or modifications to departmental requirements may be requested via a CS Petition form to the Undergraduate Education Committee. It is expected that you will have discussed the matter with a CS advisor before filing the petition.
Students with appropriate background who have consulted with a CS advisor may submit a CS Prerequisite Override Request form to the Undergraduate Education Committee to register for a particular course.

## Prerequisites
Admission to a given CS course requires completion of all the prerequisites listed in the UO Catalog. Waiver of a prerequisite is possible only through a CS Prerequisite Override Request form to the Undergraduate Education Committee.
Prerequisite Override Requests should be submitted 10 days before the registration time for which the student needs that exception.

To support interdisciplinary study, students on any concentration are encouraged to complete a minor (typically 24–32 credits) or major in a computing-related field. Students who complete a minor (other than computer information technology or mathematics) or another major (including mathematics) in a computing-related field may, with the approval of the Undergraduate Education Committee, replace the CS laboratory science requirement with the completed minor or major. Approval of a major or minor in substitution for the science concentration is not automatic. Students who wish to substitute a minor or second major for the science concentration should talk to an advisor and petition for the substitution as early as possible. The petition should clearly explain how computer science and the other major or minor are complementary.
